			<div id="about"><b style="font-size: 2.5vw">About</b><br><br>It was spring of 2019 when I got the call, driving in my car. My sister-in-law needed a prom bouquet for my niece. I had done it the previous year and of course I was delighted to do it again. And then I thought, "Huh–maybe other people want prom flowers from me." They totally did! Before I knew it, I had multiple orders for bouquets and boutonnieres and was terrified that I wouldn't have been able to do them all. Fear set in and panic quickly followed but I plugged in and got ‘em DONE.  Beautifully, I might add.  I’ve never looked back. <br><br>I’d been designing florals for years.  Weddings, baby showers, prom, centerpieces, you name it.  Mostly for friends and family but I absolutely loved it.  Designing kind of organically became my thang. I was quickly obsessed.<br><br>A month after prom, I couldn’t stop thinking about the rush I felt making those bouquets and boutonnieres and told my husband I was starting my own company.<br><br>“Go for it,” he said.<br><br>“But what should I name it?”<br><br>An angelic voice (my kid, not an actual angel – although he’s pretty d@mn close) then shouted from an adjoining room, “How about DeBear Necessities?”<br><br>“Yes. Yessssss. YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!” And voila! DeBear Necessities was born.
